# homework02.1

For this project, I decided to use my currently active portfolio on Squarespace as my target to recreate. I was actually quite proud at how closely this project resembled my personal domain. I went for a simplistic design with minimal decoration from pictures I took when I was in Switzerland a few years ago. This will actually be the foundation of one of my side projects for this class as one of my goals is to replace my Squarespace page with a page I made myself.
